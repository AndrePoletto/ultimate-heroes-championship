# Ultimate Heroes Championship

This is repo contains all source code from a challenge implementation.
The project basically consists in a simple comparison of two 'super hero' characters. (It also includes vilans and anime characters)

```bash
.
├── public # Public site information, such as favicon.
└── src # React APP
    └── components
    └── pages
    └── providers
    └── actions
    └── store
    └── reducers

```    

Unfortunately for personal issues I didn't have time to finish it.
It is missing automate testing and some code cleaning, but still, it works.

## Future improvements

- First page with heroes listing, giving the user some options.
- Unit and end-to-end tests.
- Review and refactor code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
